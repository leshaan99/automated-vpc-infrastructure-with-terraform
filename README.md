# VPC Infrastructure with Terraform and GitHub Actions  

This repository demonstrates creating a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** and its associated resources using **Terraform**, along with automated deployment using **GitHub Actions**. The infrastructure includes:  
- **VPC**  
- **EC2 Instances**  
- **Subnets**  
- **Internet Gateway**  
- **Security Groups**  
- **Route Tables**  
- **Application Load Balancer**  

## Highlights:  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Implements best practices for scalable and maintainable cloud infrastructure management.  
- **CI/CD Automation:** Leverages GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of Terraform code, ensuring streamlined and consistent infrastructure provisioning.  

This repository is ideal for learning and implementing cloud infrastructure management with IaC and CI/CD workflows.
